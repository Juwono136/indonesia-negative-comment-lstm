## Introduction
Currently, in addition to discussing in the real world, most people also engage in discussions online, one of which is by commenting on a post on social media. Sometimes, the quality of the discussion deteriorates due to the emergence of various negative comments, especially among Indonesian people who frequently comment on social media. This sentiment analysis aims to classify and make predictions about a comment so that in the future, the discussion space on social media can be improved and unnecessary conflicts can be avoided.


The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) method has been widely used, especially in NLP technology, as it has the advantage of understanding context or words in long-term memory. This sentiment analysis is still in the development stage, with the continuous addition of diverse datasets containing a wider range of sentences.

### üìë Dataset
‚û°Ô∏è The dataset originates from one of the GitHub users, namely [Ahmad Izzan and team](https://github.com/ahmadizzan/netifier), inspired by the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). 
This dataset consists of approximately 7,773 example sentences (raw_data) categorized into positive and negative sentences in the Indonesian language. 
Negative sentences are divided into 4 types: Pornography, Hate Speech (SARA), Radicalism, and Defamation, whereas positive sentences are those that do not carry negative meanings.
