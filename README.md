# Sentiment Analysis of Negative Comments on Social Media Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Introduction
------------------
Currently, social media has become a space for many people to discuss and share information. On social media, all users can provide responses or comments on a piece of informational content. 
Sometimes, within the comments on social media content, there are negative comments that make the discussion atmosphere uncomfortable for some users.
Hence, there is a need for sentiment analysis and classification of negative comments that can arise from it, such as defamation, ethnicity, race, religion, and intergroup issues (SARA), 
pornography, cyberbullying, or radicalism.

Dataset
------------------
The dataset originates from one of the GitHub users, namely [Ahmad Izzan and team](https://github.com/ahmadizzan/netifier), inspired by the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge). 
This dataset consists of approximately 7,773 example sentences categorized into positive and negative sentences in the Indonesian language. 
Negative sentences are divided into four types: pornography, Ethnicity, Race, Religion, and Intergroup (SARA) issues, radicalism, and defamation, whereas positive sentences are those that do not carry negative meanings.
